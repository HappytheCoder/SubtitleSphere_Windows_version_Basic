## AI AI Features: Google Gemini and OpenAI GPT Integration
Subtitle Sphere offers optional advanced online features that rely on the official APIs of
OpenAI and Google Gemini for translation and AI voice narration. These features require
users to provide their own API keys, and all data is transmitted directly between the user‚Äôs
device and the selected API provider.

### Supported Features:

* **OpenAI GPT:**
  * Voice generation (TTS): gpt-4o-mini-tts
  * Translation: gpt-4o-mini, gpt-4o
* **Google Gemini:**
  * Voice generation (TTS): gemini-2.5-flash-preview-tts
  * Translation: gemini-2.0-flash
 
### Important Usage Notes:
* Subtitle Sphere does not supply or store any API keys. Users must provide their own and are fully responsible for managing access, usage, and billing with OpenAI and Google.
* API keys are used only for direct requests from the software to the respective provider. No keys or data are ever sent to Subtitle Sphere‚Äôs servers.
* All requests are made securely and directly to OpenAI or Google servers.
* Your IP address and text input are transmitted as part of these requests.
* Depending on the provider and your account settings (especially on Google Studio‚Äôs free tier), data you submit may be used to improve their AI models. Do not upload any private or sensitive content.
* Subtitle Sphere is not liable for any consequences related to API billing, data retention, model behavior, or privacy risks stemming from the use of these external services.
* These AI-powered features are entirely optional. All core functionality of Subtitle Sphere (transcription, editing, separation) works offline without using Gemini or GPT.
